      <h2 >Comparison of people's daily exercise volume and mortality from 1977 to 1985</h2>
      <p>It is not difficult to find in the chart that those who have too little and too much exercise show
higher mortality. This means that if you do not have sufficient daily exercise, it will have a
negative impact on the human body, leading to an increased chance of sudden death. But excess
exercise can also make your health worse. Then it is very important to find this balance, but it is a
very difficult thing.

      <h2>Life Expectancy of 50-year-olds at Three Different Exercise Levels</h2>
      <p>In the chart, we can see that in the most ideal sports state, that is, the people who exercise moderately are a minority, but their life expectancy is the longest. This shows that even if many people have the awareness of the need for exercise, they cannot master the correct method. And it takes time and trouble to find a training method that is really suitable for each one of us. It requires a lot of professional knowledge and a precise understanding of your body.

      <h2>Comparison of Body Weight Between Patients with Mental Illness and Normal People</h2>
      <p>This chart shows the difference between the average weight of mentally ill patients and the normal population. It is not difficult to see that people who usually have mental illness often do not have the weight index of the normal population, and they will either be higher or lower than it. This shows that mental health is an important factor that affects physical health and will directly affect a person's physical state. Although most of the time mental health is related to the growth environment, this does not mean that we have no way to change it.
