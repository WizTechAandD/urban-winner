      <h2 >Chronic Conditions by Sleep Duration</h2>
      <p>People who get less than 7 hours of sleep are more likely to report chronic health conditions such as stroke, depression, cancer, etc. This tells us that sleep is one of the necessary components of recovery and healing. If one does not get good quality sleep, chronic health conditions will arise as the body isn’t recovered properly and this leads to over stressing the body.

      <h2>Short Sleep Duration Among HS Students</h2>
      <p>With highschool students, around two thirds report having less than 8 hours per night. Students with insufficient sleep increase as they pass a grade. Short sleep duration is lowest among grade 9 students and highest among grade 12 students. This could suggest that as students pass a grade the subject matter increases in difficulty and the course loads increase, especially with added pressure to choose courses that will be needed for a college or university that the students aren’t completely decided on.

      <p>You also have an option to connect other devices. If you're using another device before going to bed, it could reduce your chances of going to sleep on time. This is a good way to keep you secured in keeping your schedule. You can connect to other computers, laptops, other phones, or tablets.

      <h2>Health Risk Factors by Sleep Duration</h2>
      <p>Short sleepers were linked to a higher risk in obesity, smoking more, and a higher chance of consuming alcohol in excess than people with sufficient sleep. This could mean that not getting enough sleep could lead people to worsen with addictions which diminishes their health. Not getting sufficient sleep will make it harder to quit any addictions one may have.

<p>We know that having the phone completely useless might be some trouble. Sometimes there may be a late night emergency if you need to make a call or someone's calling you. There might be an emergency that relates to your poor health condition because of sleep deprivation. So, we've allowed you to keep your contacts and phone functional while the rest of the phone's features are locked.
