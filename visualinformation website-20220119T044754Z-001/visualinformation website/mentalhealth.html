      <h2 >Death rate boys aged 15 - 19</h2>

      <h2>Depression-by-level-of-employment in Austria)</h2>
      <p>Depression in the working population is also complex, and its causes have not been well understood. However, it is recognized that risk factors unrelated to work play a role, such as a workplace impact of excessive work stress on employees and the impact of depression on employees in the workplace. Evidence is accumulating that links work organizations to depression and other mental health problems, as well as increased productivity losses. Multiple studies of various occupations have identified several sources of work stress that may be associated with depression (e.g., high work requirements, low work control, lack of social support in the workplace).
